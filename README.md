# Basic-Java-Codes
This repo contains a compilation of all the programs I have made during my Java programming language journey. Detailed explanation has been provided for each problem, thus the repo can also be used as a tutorial point :D

## Please navigate to the \src\edu\vit\corejava\basics directory to access all the java codes.
>Simple nomenclature has been used for program names to give you an idea as to what the program is about.

### Feel free to clone the repository and access the codes.
